## EDA_Facebook

**Introduction:**
In this data science project I am going to analyse facebook utilisation and I will try to find insights through available data.

**Conclusion**
Primary active users are of the age group 18-24 for both male and female.
Average friend of female i.e. 241 is higher than that of male i.e. 165.
Female leads with an average tenure of 587 days compared to male of 504 days.
On average a person receives 143 likes while gives 156 likes.
Users prefer using mobile more compared to web.

**Actionable Insights**
The advertisement which we are targeting for facebook should be more inclined towards female users.
Design of advertisement should be mobile friendly that is it should show on the mobile device properly and make the platform more mobile friendly.
We need to push more content to attract senior people and parents to attract them on the platform.
